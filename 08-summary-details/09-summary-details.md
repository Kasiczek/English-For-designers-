## Article
Due to the uniqueness of SCIT's focus, the inspiration was very limited for me. When creating the corporate design, 
I tried to inspire companies with a similar technical focus or at least a similar nature. I tried to be inspired by 
the theoretical elaboration of technical companies, which I usually didn't like very much. As a result, I had to find 
my own path and create this identity through my own creative process.

I worked with several factors when creating the SCIT logo. The first was to connect all the things the company does and incorporate them 
into a single logo. Since the company deals with the connection of water supply systems with information technologies, 
I tried to connect these things in the logo as well.One factor was water, which was represented by color. 
The connection as such is shown mainly typographically in the logotype.

When creating websites I came across a problem: the company basically does not have the means to visually present the service that it provides. So I approached the design of their services through animations and illustrations.
