## Abstract

In its first part, this work deals with the definition of corporate visual identity and the things connected with it. 
Parts such as the image and corporate culture. Furthermore, the theoretical part deals with the logo. It also discusses 
the graphic manual and things to be mentioned, such as corporate colors and their use. The brand and its function are also defined. 
In the last chapters, the first part defines the product and graphic elements. The practical part aimed to create an unified visual 
style for the company SCIT. It analyzes its individual parts, therefore: the creation of a logo, website, and corporate publication.

## Article
Due to the uniqueness of SCIT's focus, the inspiration was very limited for me. When creating the corporate design, 
I tried to inspire companies with a similar technical focus or at least a similar nature. I tried to be inspired by 
the theoretical elaboration of technical companies, which I usually didn't like very much. As a result, I had to find 
my own path and create this identity through my own creative process.

I worked with several factors when creating the SCIT logo. The first was to connect all the things the company does and incorporate them 
into a single logo. Since the company deals with the connection of water supply systems with information technologies, 
I tried to connect these things in the logo as well.One factor was water, which was represented by color. 
The connection as such is shown mainly typographically in the logotype.

When creating websites I came across a problem: the company basically does not have the means to visually present the service that it provides. So I approached the design of their services through animations and illustrations.

For the company SCIT, I created a series of corporate publications.

###  Bussiness card
One of the created printed materials was a business card of a classic format. On the one hand, the illustrations of artificial intelligence, which have been used several times, follow the SCIT logo together with the title "automatic systems with artificial intelligence". On the back, the contact details are enriched with a QR code modified in the style of graphic elements so that with them
merges (this is the generation of a contact to add to the phone).

### Brochure
The largest print is product brochure in A4 landscape, the content was therefore adjusted for example arcade "How it works". On the introductory page, the edited scene is transferred from the web animation. Information about artificial intelligence and statistics is supplemented by a stylized electronic brain illustrating the process of data processing. The last page contains contact information.

### Email signature
A simple stylized box was created as a signature to the email. This is a picture instead of a footer, again it is stylized with graphic elements.

### Business offer
For the implementation of projects, a document "Offer" was created with space for project documentation, again styled to other documents. The document is created for editing in Word, but the elements contained in it are created externally in a graphics program

### Logo manual

Together with the logo, I created a company logo manual setting out the basic principles of working with the logo and the elements associated with it. The stated principles in the manual are the protection zone of the logo and its permitted color and other modifications. There is also a company font and some examples of logo applications.
