## About copying in my career of graphic designer.

Only few thing i created was completely original. I realized in first years of my high school that almost everything was already created every 
idea and all visual techniques has been used. At that moment i just started picking best things i liked in projects i found on the internet. 
Then transforming them and using them in specific scenarios and projects i made. 

Everything nowdays is about coping. Basicly the idea of mood board and ispiration of project similar to that you are creating is kinda copying 
things that you like them. If i dont have access to websides like behanace or dribble i wouldn't do projects like I do now. To create to have to
inspire.
