## About copying in my career as a graphic designer.

Only a few things i created was completely original. I realized in the first years of my high school that almost everything was already created every idea and all visual techniques have been used. At that moment i just started picking the best things i liked in projects i found on the internet. 
Then transforming them and using them in specific scenarios and projects i made. 

Everything nowadays is about coping. Basically, the idea of the mood board and inspiration of the project similar to that you are creating is kinda copying things that you like. If i didn't have access to websites like Behance or dribbble i wouldn't do projects as I do now. To create to have to
inspire.

I'm adding a few projects from Behance and dribbble that inspired me (or i gave them like) in the last few years.

From dribble I'm not keeping track of things that inspired me but i was searching for some inspiration for cow illustration and there are some pretty good ones.
