Service & Consulting IT
</p>

I choose this project because its my favorite. It is relly complex identity that i created just by myself (with constultation of my superior at work).
The think that make this project special for me its his exceptionality. 

Nobody really knows anything about what they are doing. So first it was very difficult to understand the proces that they are doing with their clients.

## What is SCIT actually doing? 
We have been dealing with the system of automated control of water supply and sewerage equipment for many years. We know very well the functioning of these units, we know how to handle them and how to make the best use of them. We also deal with the development of hardware and software so that we can always offer the best technology.

In addition to construction companies that are looking for suppliers of control systems for construction projects, we are also approached by design offices or directly by cities, municipalities and industrial or agricultural operations.

That is, all those who are looking for a modern, reliable and safe system that will help them effectively manage water or sewage equipment, which can save time, energy and, above all, resources.

## Procest of creating visual presentation of SCIT
So as i already mention, most difficult thing about creating scit was understanding what they are relly doing. 
Also lack of any information about competetion or inspiration.

Lot of ilustration of proses was created and some of them in motion. 

## Result
Well we created everything for SCIT from logo, webside, bussiness card to animation, brochure to complete car sticker and other things.

## Aftermath
During proces i have chose it for my bachelor thesis because i think its great example of visual identity.
