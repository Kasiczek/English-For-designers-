### Keywords

### Motivation/Problem/Opportunity
My motivation and problem that I wanted to resolve in my bachelors thesis was to create unigue design of 
technic company that does not have anything to be presented with. And show that it is posible to present ugly things in
nice way.


### Thesis
In its first part, this work deals with the definition of corporate visual identity and the things connected with it. Parts such as the image and corporate culture. Furthermore, the theoretical part deals with the logo. It also discusses the graphic manual and things to be mentioned, such as corporate colors and their use. The brand and its function are also defined. In the last chapters, the first part defines the product and graphic elements. 	The practical part aimed to create an unified visual style for the company SCIT. It analyzes its individual parts, therefore: the creation of a logo, website, and corporate publication.



### Approach/Methodology
Im using simple work analysis and trying to put it together to make sense.



### Conclusion
In conclusion, I would like to add that corporate identity is a really large and important area for most companies. When creating it, each company is a different process of a different nature and scope. What every corporate style should share, however, is its uniqueness and functionality. The style I created for SCIT meets these requirements, and it is a successful project.
